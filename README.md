# Web Development Projects Hub

This repository contains a collection of web development projects built using **HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5, and JavaScript**.  
The projects were developed as part of my learning journey as a **Computer Science Education student at Lead City University**.

The main entry point is an `index.html` file that links to each project.
